## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This project explores how **college students manage food expenses** in campus cafeterias.  
Using **survey data and R Studio**, we analyzed spending habits, social influences, and exam-time variations to build predictive models for cafeteria expenditure.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Method
- Conducted a structured student survey (canteen visits, budget, payment methods).  
- Analyzed data using **R & ggplot2** for visualization (bar, pie, line charts).  
- Applied **predictive models** to forecast expenditure and food choices.  
- Performed **hypothesis testing** (cash vs mobile payments).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Findings
- Most students spend **â‚¹0â€“100 per visit**, 2â€“3 times weekly.  
- **Exam periods â†’ lower spending** as students prioritize academics.  
- **Peer influence & trends** affect some students, while many remain budget-conscious.  
- **Mobile payments** (UPI/Google Pay) are more popular than cash.  
- Students demand **affordable pricing, variety, and eco-friendly options**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Offers insights for **canteen management** to improve food options, pricing, and crowd handling.  
- Encourages students to develop **better financial habits**.  
- Can be scaled into a **smart cafeteria system** with predictive analytics.
