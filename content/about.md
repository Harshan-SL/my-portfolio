Hi again! I’m **Harshan S L**, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student from **Chennai, Tamil Nadu**.

I’ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity slowly turned into a passion for antennas, RF, and signal processing. Over the years, I’ve learned and explored different tools and technologies — from Python and MATLAB for analysis, to Verilog and Cadence for digital design and VLSI.

Maybe it sounds like too many directions at once, but I believe the best way to learn is to dive in, experiment, and make mistakes along the way. Each experiment, whether successful or not, has helped me grow both technically and personally.

Right now, I’m preparing myself for the next step: finding internship and placement opportunities where I can apply my skills, face new challenges, and gain real-world industry exposure.
