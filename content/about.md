🤚🏻 Hi, I’m **Harshan S L** — an **Electronics and Communication Engineering** student.

I’m in my **third year at VIT Chennai**, where I love exploring how hardware and software come together to make smart systems. From microcontrollers and sensors to IoT devices and edge AI, I enjoy building things that connect the physical and digital worlds.

### 🚀 How It All Began

It all started in school when I powered up my first Arduino and made an LED blink. That tiny blink felt like *magic I could control* — and I’ve been hooked ever since.

I started experimenting with sensors, circuits, and communication systems, then moved on to ESP32 projects, signal processing in MATLAB, and automation with Python. Over time, I realized my passion lies in **making hardware think smarter**.

### ⚙️ My Journey So Far

I’ve had the chance to learn and grow through several experiences:

* **Technical Lead @ IEEE SSCS (VIT Chennai)** – leading embedded and solid-state circuit projects.
* **Intern @ NIT Trichy** – simulated antennas and wireless systems in HFSS and MATLAB.
* **Intern @ India Space Academy** – worked with cosmological data to estimate the Hubble parameter using Python.
* **Member @ IEEE Photonics Society** – contributed to optical communication outreach and design.

These roles helped me connect theory with real-world systems — from **RF simulations** to **IoT prototypes**.

### 🌱 Outside the Lab

When I’m not soldering circuits or debugging code, you’ll probably find me:

* Exploring **minimalist design** and tech aesthetics.
* Learning new tools and building side projects for fun.
* Contributing to student tech communities.
* Sketching out ideas for my next prototype or portfolio update.

### ✨ What’s Next

I’m currently diving deeper into **IoT systems**, **embedded AI**, and **wireless communication**, with the goal of building devices that are **smart, connected, and sustainable**.
