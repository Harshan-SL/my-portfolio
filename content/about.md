🤚🏻 Hi again! I'm **Harshan S L**, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student and an **Embedded Systems & IoT Developer** from India 🇮🇳.

I’m currently in my **third year at VIT Chennai**, and I’m deeply passionate about building things that connect the physical and digital worlds — where **hardware meets intelligence**.

Over the past few years, I’ve explored everything from **microcontrollers and communication systems** to **edge AI and IoT prototypes**. I’ve worked on ESP32-based devices, signal analysis in MATLAB, and automation scripts in Python — constantly experimenting to see how everyday electronics can think smarter.

### 🚀 How It All Started

My journey with electronics began back in school — the moment I powered up my first Arduino board and saw an LED blink, I was hooked. That single blink felt like *magic I could control.*

Soon after:
- I started exploring sensors, circuits, and the logic behind how devices communicate.  
- Built small IoT projects using ESP8266 and ESP32 boards.  
- Got fascinated by **signal processing** — the invisible language that keeps our world connected.  
- Started combining my love for **hardware** with **software automation** using Python.

What began as curiosity slowly turned into a vision:  
> To bridge embedded hardware with intelligent, efficient software — one project at a time.

### ⚙️ My Technical Journey So Far

I’ve been part of several communities and projects that helped shape my skills:
- **Technical Lead @ IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (VIT Chennai):** leading embedded and solid-state projects.  
- **Intern @ NIT Trichy:** simulated antennas and wireless systems using HFSS and MATLAB.  
- **Intern @ India Space Academy:** analyzed cosmological data to estimate the Hubble parameter using Python.  
- **Team Member @ IEEE Photonics Society:** worked on optical communication outreach and design.  

These experiences helped me connect theory with real-world systems — from **RF simulations to IoT prototypes**.

### 🌱 Beyond Circuits and Code

Not everything in my life runs on voltage and logic gates.  
When I’m not experimenting with microcontrollers or debugging MATLAB scripts, I enjoy:

- Exploring **minimalist design** and visual aesthetics.  
- Learning **new tools and technologies** just for the joy of discovery.  
- Contributing to **student tech communities** and sharing knowledge.  
- Spending quiet evenings sketching out ideas for my next project (or redesigning my portfolio).

### ✨ Looking Ahead

Right now, I’m working on strengthening my skills in **IoT systems**, **embedded AI**, and **wireless communication** — aiming to create devices that are both **smart and sustainable**.  

I believe the future belongs to those who can make machines *sense, think, and communicate* — and I want to be part of building that future.
