Iâ€™m Harshan S L, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student from Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\nIâ€™ve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity slowly turned into a passion for antennas, RF, and signal processing. Over the years, Iâ€™ve learned and explored different tools and technologies â€” from Python and MATLAB for analysis, to Verilog and Cadence for digital design and VLSI.\nMaybe it sounds like too many directions at once, but I believe the best way to learn is to dive in, experiment, and make mistakes along the way. Each experiment, whether successful or not, has helped me grow both technically and personally.\nRight now, Iâ€™m preparing myself for the next step: finding internship and placement opportunities where I can apply my skills, face new challenges, and gain real-world industry exposure.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"Advanced antenna design using 3D printed substrate for enhanced performance and reduced size.\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/miniaturization-antenna/","section":" Projects","summary":"Advanced antenna design using 3D printed substrate for enhanced performance and reduced size.","title":"Miniaturized Microstrip Patch Antenna","type":"projects"},{"content":"High-performance digital multiplier design implemented using Cadence Virtuoso.\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/braun-array-multiplier/","section":" Projects","summary":"High-performance digital multiplier design implemented using Cadence Virtuoso.","title":"Braun Array Multiplier","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/bluetooth-rfid-robot/","section":" Projects","summary":"Bluetooth-controlled robot integrated with an RFID-based access system.","title":"Bluetooth-Controlled Robot with RFID-Based Access System","type":"projects"},{"content":"Advanced cosmological data analysis using Pantheon+SHOES dataset for universe expansion study.\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/supernova-analysis/","section":" Projects","summary":"Advanced cosmological data analysis using Pantheon+SHOES dataset for universe expansion study.","title":"Supernova Cosmology Analysis","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rðŸ”¹ Overview #\rThis project explores how college students manage food expenses in campus cafeterias.\nUsing survey data and R Studio, we analyzed spending habits, social influences, and exam-time variations to build predictive models for cafeteria expenditure.\nðŸ”¹ Method #\rConducted a structured student survey (canteen visits, budget, payment methods). Analyzed data using R \u0026amp; ggplot2 for visualization (bar, pie, line charts). Applied predictive models to forecast expenditure and food choices. Performed hypothesis testing (cash vs mobile payments). ðŸ”¹ Key Findings #\rMost students spend â‚¹0â€“100 per visit, 2â€“3 times weekly. Exam periods â†’ lower spending as students prioritize academics. Peer influence \u0026amp; trends affect some students, while many remain budget-conscious. Mobile payments (UPI/Google Pay) are more popular than cash. Students demand affordable pricing, variety, and eco-friendly options. ðŸ”¹ Impact #\rOffers insights for canteen management to improve food options, pricing, and crowd handling. Encourages students to develop better financial habits.
