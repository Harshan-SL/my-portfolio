I‚Äôm Harshan S L, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student from Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\nI‚Äôve always been curious about how things work, and that curiosity slowly turned into a passion for antennas, RF, and signal processing. Over the years, I‚Äôve learned and explored different tools and technologies ‚Äî from Python and MATLAB for analysis, to Verilog and Cadence for digital design and VLSI.\nMaybe it sounds like too many directions at once, but I believe the best way to learn is to dive in, experiment, and make mistakes along the way. Each experiment, whether successful or not, has helped me grow both technically and personally.\nRight now, I‚Äôm preparing myself for the next step: finding internship and placement opportunities where I can apply my skills, face new challenges, and gain real-world industry exposure.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"\rI am a third-year Electronics \u0026 Communication Engineering undergrad from Chennai.

Among these, RFID-based attendance systems are reliable, secure, and efficient.\nThis project demonstrates an RFID Attendance Management System using Arduino Uno, designed to automate attendance logging, improve efficiency, and reduce manual errors.\nSystem Overview #\rWhen a registered RFID card is scanned:\n‚úÖ Green LED + Short buzzer tone ‚Üí Attendance recorded successfully. ‚ùå Red LED + Long buzzer tone ‚Üí Invalid/unregistered card detected. The system also logs attendance data with date, time, and user details in real-time, which can be exported to Excel or a database for reporting.\nHardware Setup #\rArduino Uno ‚Äì Microcontroller for system control. RFID RC522 Module ‚Äì Reads RFID cards. LEDs (Green \u0026amp; Red) ‚Äì Visual feedback. Buzzer ‚Äì Audio feedback. Wiring Connections #\rSDA ‚Üí Pin 10 SCK ‚Üí Pin 13 MOSI ‚Üí Pin 11 MISO ‚Üí Pin 12 RST ‚Üí Pin 9 Green LED ‚Üí Pin 5 Red LED ‚Üí Pin 6 Buzzer ‚Üí Pin 7 Software Implementation #\rArduino communicates with the RFID module using SPI protocol. The system continuously checks for new RFID cards. Each card‚Äôs UID (Unique Identifier) is compared with stored valid IDs. Attendance is logged in the format: Attendance Logging #\rValid card ‚Üí Record stored with timestamp. Invalid card ‚Üí Rejected with feedback. Data can be displayed on the Serial Monitor or exported to Excel/database for reporting. DATA, Date, Time, Name, UserNumber RFID RC522 Pin Configuration #\rPin No. Name Description 1 VCC Power supply (3.3V) 2 RST Reset pin 3 GND Ground 4 IRQ Interrupt pin (wake-up signal) 5 MISO/SCL/TX MISO for SPI, SCL for I¬≤C, TX for UART 6 MOSI Master Out Slave In (SPI) 7 SCK Serial Clock (SPI) 8 SS/SDA/RX SS for SPI, SDA for I¬≤C, RX for UART Results #\r‚úÖ Automated attendance logging achieved. ‚úÖ Real-time validation with LED + buzzer feedback. ‚úÖ Data export possible for reporting and analysis. Conclusion #\rThis RFID-based Attendance Management System provides a secure, efficient, and user-friendly solution for managing attendance in schools, colleges, offices, and events.\nIt simplifies the traditional process while reducing errors and improving overall operational efficiency.\n","date":"2025 08 24","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/rfid/","section":" üìå
