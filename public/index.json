From microcontrollers and sensors to IoT devices and edge AI, I enjoy building things that connect the physical and digital worlds.\n🚀 How It All Began #\rIt all started in school when I powered up my first Arduino and made an LED blink. That tiny blink felt like magic I could control — and I’ve been hooked ever since.\nI started experimenting with sensors, circuits, and communication systems, then moved on to ESP32 projects, signal processing in MATLAB, and automation with Python. Over time, I realized my passion lies in making hardware think smarter.\n⚙️ My Journey So Far #\rI’ve had the chance to learn and grow through several experiences:\nTechnical Lead @ IEEE SSCS (VIT Chennai) – leading embedded and solid-state circuit projects. Intern @ NIT Trichy – simulated antennas and wireless systems in HFSS and MATLAB. Intern @ India Space Academy – worked with cosmological data to estimate the Hubble parameter using Python. Member @ IEEE Photonics Society – contributed to optical communication outreach and design. These roles helped me connect theory with real-world systems — from RF simulations to IoT prototypes.\n🌱 Outside the Lab #\rWhen I’m not soldering circuits or debugging code, you’ll probably find me:\nExploring minimalist design and tech aesthetics. Learning new tools and building side projects for fun. Contributing to student tech communities. Sketching out ideas for my next prototype or portfolio update. ✨ What’s Next #\rI’m currently diving deeper into IoT systems, embedded AI, and wireless communication, with the goal of building devices that are smart, connected, and sustainable.\nBridging embedded systems with intelligent technology — one project at a time.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"\rTechnical Lead\rFeb 2025 – Present\rIEEE Solid State Society · VIT Chennai\rLeading technical initiatives and guiding members in solid-state electronics research.\rCoordinating projects and mentoring peers.\rAstronomy \u0026amp; Astrophysics Intern\rJun – Jul 2025\rIndia Space Academy · Remote\rConducted cosmological data analysis.\rWorked on Hubble parameter estimation using real datasets.\rSummer Intern\rMay – Jun 2025\rNIT Tiruchirappalli\rWorked on antenna performance analysis and simulation.\rDesigned and optimized RF structures.\rTeam Member\rSep 2024 – Jun 2025\rIEEE Photonics Society · VIT Chennai\rDesigned technical posters and coordinated society events.\rAssisted in marketing and outreach activities.

Analyzed data using R \u0026amp; ggplot2 for visualization (bar, pie, line charts). Applied predictive models to forecast expenditure and food choices. Performed hypothesis testing (cash vs mobile payments). 🔹 Key Findings #\rMost students spend ₹0–100 per visit, 2–3 times weekly. Exam periods → lower spending as students prioritize academics. Peer influence \u0026amp; trends affect some students, while many remain budget-conscious. Mobile payments (UPI/Google Pay) are more popular than cash. Students demand affordable pricing, variety, and eco-friendly options. 🔹 Impact #\rOffers insights for canteen management to improve food options, pricing, and crowd handling. Encourages students to develop better financial habits. Can be scaled into a smart cafeteria system with predictive analytics. 👥 Team: Hariprasath M · Harshan S L\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/student-expenditure-analysis/","section":" Projects","summary":"Comprehensive statistical analysis of student spending patterns using R Studio.","title":"Student Expenditure Analysis","type":"projects"},{"content":"A simple RFID-based attendance system built using Arduino Uno, RC522 RFID module, RTC, LEDs, and buzzer.\nWhen a valid RFID card is scanned, the system logs the attendance with date and time, shows a green LED, and plays a confirmation tone.\nFor invalid cards, it shows a red LED and a warning buzzer.\n✅ Features\nAutomated attendance logging Real-time feedback (LED + buzzer) Data exportable to Excel 🔧 Tools \u0026amp; Tech\nArduino UNO · RFID (RC522) · RTC · LEDs \u0026amp; Buzzer\n🚀 Impact\nReduces manual errors, saves time, and provides a reliable attendance tracking method.\n👥 Team: Hariprasath M · Harshan S L · Rathnavelan\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/attendance-management/","section":" Projects","summary":"Automated attendance tracking system with RFID card integration and database management.","title":"Attendance Management Using RFID","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/smart-home-system/","section":" Projects","summary":"Temperature Controlled Fan with home automation","title":"Smart Home system","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rHi there,I am Harshan.
