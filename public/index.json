[{"content":"🤚🏻 Hi again! I\u0026rsquo;m Harshan S L, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student and an Embedded Systems \u0026amp; IoT Developer from India 🇮🇳.\nI’m currently in my third year at VIT Chennai, and I’m deeply passionate about building things that connect the physical and digital worlds — where hardware meets intelligence.\nOver the past few years, I’ve explored everything from microcontrollers and communication systems to edge AI and IoT prototypes. I’ve worked on ESP32-based devices, signal analysis in MATLAB, and automation scripts in Python — constantly experimenting to see how everyday electronics can think smarter.\n🚀 How It All Started #\rMy journey with electronics began back in school — the moment I powered up my first Arduino board and saw an LED blink, I was hooked. That single blink felt like magic I could control.\nSoon after:\nI started exploring sensors, circuits, and the logic behind how devices communicate. Built small IoT projects using ESP8266 and ESP32 boards. Got fascinated by signal processing — the invisible language that keeps our world connected. Started combining my love for hardware with software automation using Python. What began as curiosity slowly turned into a vision:\nTo bridge embedded hardware with intelligent, efficient software — one project at a time.\n⚙️ My Technical Journey So Far #\rI’ve been part of several communities and projects that helped shape my skills:\nTechnical Lead @ IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society (VIT Chennai): leading embedded and solid-state projects. Intern @ NIT Trichy: simulated antennas and wireless systems using HFSS and MATLAB. Intern @ India Space Academy: analyzed cosmological data to estimate the Hubble parameter using Python. Team Member @ IEEE Photonics Society: worked on optical communication outreach and design. These experiences helped me connect theory with real-world systems — from RF simulations to IoT prototypes.\n🌱 Beyond Circuits and Code #\rNot everything in my life runs on voltage and logic gates.\nWhen I’m not experimenting with microcontrollers or debugging MATLAB scripts, I enjoy:\nExploring minimalist design and visual aesthetics. Learning new tools and technologies just for the joy of discovery. Contributing to student tech communities and sharing knowledge. Spending quiet evenings sketching out ideas for my next project (or redesigning my portfolio). ✨ Looking Ahead #\rRight now, I’m working on strengthening my skills in IoT systems, embedded AI, and wireless communication — aiming to create devices that are both smart and sustainable.\nI believe the future belongs to those who can make machines sense, think, and communicate — and I want to be part of building that future.\n“Bridging embedded systems with intelligent technology — one project at a time.”\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"\rTechnical Lead\rFeb 2025 – Present\rIEEE Solid State Society · VIT Chennai\rLeading technical initiatives and guiding members in solid-state electronics research.\rCoordinating projects and mentoring peers.\rAstronomy \u0026amp; Astrophysics Intern\rJun – Jul 2025\rIndia Space Academy · Remote\rConducted cosmological data analysis.\rWorked on Hubble parameter estimation using real datasets.\rSummer Intern\rMay – Jun 2025\rNIT Tiruchirappalli\rWorked on antenna performance analysis and simulation.\rDesigned and optimized RF structures.\rTeam Member\rSep 2024 – Jun 2025\rIEEE Photonics Society · VIT Chennai\rDesigned technical posters and coordinated society events.\rAssisted in marketing and outreach activities.

Analyzed data using R \u0026amp; ggplot2 for visualization (bar, pie, line charts). Applied predictive models to forecast expenditure and food choices. Performed hypothesis testing (cash vs mobile payments). 🔹 Key Findings #\rMost students spend ₹0–100 per visit, 2–3 times weekly. Exam periods → lower spending as students prioritize academics. Peer influence \u0026amp; trends affect some students, while many remain budget-conscious. Mobile payments (UPI/Google Pay) are more popular than cash. Students demand affordable pricing, variety, and eco-friendly options. 🔹 Impact #\rOffers insights for canteen management to improve food options, pricing, and crowd handling. Encourages students to develop better financial habits. Can be scaled into a smart cafeteria system with predictive analytics. 👥 Team: Hariprasath M · Harshan S L\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/student-expenditure-analysis/","section":" Projects","summary":"Comprehensive statistical analysis of student spending patterns using R Studio.","title":"Student Expenditure Analysis","type":"projects"},{"content":"A simple RFID-based attendance system built using Arduino Uno, RC522 RFID module, RTC, LEDs, and buzzer.\nWhen a valid RFID card is scanned, the system logs the attendance with date and time, shows a green LED, and plays a confirmation tone.\nFor invalid cards, it shows a red LED and a warning buzzer.\n✅ Features\nAutomated attendance logging Real-time feedback (LED + buzzer) Data exportable to Excel 🔧 Tools \u0026amp; Tech\nArduino UNO · RFID (RC522) · RTC · LEDs \u0026amp; Buzzer\n🚀 Impact\nReduces manual errors, saves time, and provides a reliable attendance tracking method.\n👥 Team: Hariprasath M · Harshan S L · Rathnavelan\n","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/attendance-management/","section":" Projects","summary":"Automated attendance tracking system with RFID card integration and database management.","title":"Attendance Management Using RFID","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"2025 08 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/smart-home-system/","section":" Projects","summary":"Temperature Controlled Fan with home automation","title":"Smart Home system","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rHi there,I am Harshan.
